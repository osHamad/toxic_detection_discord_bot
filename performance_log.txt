performance of gaussian naive bayes:
frac: 0.25
score out of 1: ~0.89
confusion matrix: 
[[6951, 311]
[491, 226]]
total toxic: 537
total not toxic: 7082
false negative rate (toxic but predicted not toxic): 0.68
false positive rate (not toxic but predicted toxic): 0.04
performance failure: false negative rates are too high. likely due to a class imbalance.




performance of XGBoost:
model frac: 0.25
score out of 1: ~0.92
confusion matrix:
[[6839, 437]
[170, 533]]
total toxic: 537
total not toxic: 7082
false negative rate (toxic but predicted not toxic): 0.24
false positive rate (not toxic but predicted toxic): 0.06

performance of XGBoost:
(after tuning hyperparameters)
model frac: 0.75
score out of 1: ~0.94
